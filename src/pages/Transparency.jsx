              Beejam does not rely on declarations, labels, or goodwill.
              We rely on verification.
              Every Beejam-managed plot follows a strict zero-synthetic-input policy —
              covering fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and growth regulators.

            <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-relaxed opacity-80">
              Soil and produce samples are periodically tested through independent labs.
              These results are documented and reviewed internally.
              If synthetic residue is detected, the farmer is immediately removed from the system.
              This rule is absolute.

              There are no warnings and no second chances.
              Chemical use permanently breaks the trust loop —
              not because mistakes are unforgivable,
              but because the soil pays the price long after.
